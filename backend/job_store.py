"""Durable job registry backing `_JOBS` in app.py.

The in-memory dict alone loses every in-flight job (transcription, Claude
selection) if the process crashes or restarts — for a long transcription that
can mean redoing an hour of work. This writes job state through to a small
SQLite file on every update, so `app.py` can reload it on startup and either
reattach to the still-running external job (Rev.ai) or, where no external job
exists to reattach to (Claude selection), re-run it from the saved input
instead of losing the request entirely.

SQLite (not Redis) is deliberate here: it's stdlib, needs no extra service to
run/deploy, and comfortably handles this load (a handful of writes per job per
poll interval). Swap for Redis only once this runs as more than one process.
